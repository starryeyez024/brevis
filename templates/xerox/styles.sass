// Import Base theme base variables, mixins and extends:
// This includes external libraries like compass, toolkit, etc.
@import "init"

//@import "base_utilities"

// Import sub variables that may override any set in the base theme:
@import "utilities/**/*"

// Then import base styles:
//@import "base_components"

// NOTICE!!!!!
// If you need to add additional Sass Styles, do not add them here!!
// Instead create a new partial in one of the following directories:
@import "elements/**/*"
@import "components/**/*"




// We are importing variables, abstractions, base styles and components
// using globbing.
//
// Globbing will always import files alphabetically. Optimally, all your
// components should be self-contained and explicit enough to not have any
// contained styles leak into unrelated components: The import order should not
// affect the result.
//
// If there are variables, functions or mixins that depend on each other and
// therefore need to be imported in a specific order you can import them
// directly. Variables-, function- or mixin providing partials should never
// output any styles themselves: Importing them multiple times to resolve
// dependencies shouldn't be a problem.
